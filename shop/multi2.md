desc: This is a fun self personal project elaborated by Michelle Hudson who enjoys making zingy collage work. She was looking though old magazines her sister was going to throw out. Itâ€™s amazing what you can do with other peoples garbage. Then she used other types of media like sparkles, string and textures to make this magnificent piece.
