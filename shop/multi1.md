desc: This is a wonderful piece done by a local deigned James Martin. This is a collage of his personal experience. The imaged where taken by himself during the London Olympics in 2012. Then he arranged all the images in photoshop. played with the levels and curves, masked out the images and placed in a different way. Adding texture on the background made a big hit for this poster.
