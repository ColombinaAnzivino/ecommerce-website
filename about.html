        <h1>About</h1>
        
        <p>We started out in our garage back in the 90’s. We had the luck to come across amazing artists who didn’t know how to expose themselves or just had a hard time. They didn’t have the money nor the resources to do so. We also went to a lot of garage sales and found quality pieces as well as art juts laying in the trash. We eventually expanded to a small studio-like place were we have a team of people who take care of the quality and rate what it’s worth. You are always getting a good bargain at GRP Vine as well as giving Designers an opportunity.</p>
